 ## [PreviousCodes.Main method](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Main.java)
* ## [Class and Object](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Class_Object_Demo.java)
* ## [Abstract class](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/AbstractDemo.java)
    #### A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
* ## [If-Else](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/IfElseDemo.java)
* ## [Inheritance](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Inheritance_and_Polymorphism.java)
    #### Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to other classes; for example, the relationship between father and son. Inheritance in Java is a process of acquiring all the behaviours of a parent object.
* ## [Polymorphism](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Inheritance_and_Polymorphism.java)
* ## [Static Keyword](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Class_Object_Demo.java)
     #### The static keyword is a non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.
* ## [Method Overloading](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/method_overloading.java)
* ## [Super keyword](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/AbstractDemo.java)
* ## [Switch-Case](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/SwichDemo.java)
* ## [For loop](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/ForLoop_Demo.java)
* ## [While loop](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/WhileLoop_Demo.java)
* ## [Enum](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Enum_Demo.java)
* # Exception Handling
     #### An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during program execution. It affects the flow of the program instructions which can cause the program to terminate abnormally.
     #### An exception can occur for many reasons. Some of them are: Invalid user input, Device failure, Loss of network connection, Physical limitations (out of disk       memory), Code errors, Opening an unavailable file
    * ## [try-catch](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/tryCatch_Demo.java)
    * ## [Nested try-catch](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Nested_tryCatch.java)
    * ## [Multiple catch](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/multipleCatch_Demo.java)
    * ## [User Defined Exceptions](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/User_Defined_Exception.java)
    * ## [Finally Block](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Finally_Demo.java)
       #### Java finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection, stream etc. Java finally block is always executed whether exception is handled or not.
* # File Handling
     #### File Handling is an integral part of any programming language as file handling enables us to store the output of any particular program in a file and allows           us to perform certain operations on it.In simple words, file handling means reading and writing data to a file.
    * ## [Create a File](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Creating_New_File.java)
    * ## [Write a File](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/writing_to_File.java)
    * ## [Read a File](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Read_a_File.java)
    * ## [Delete a File](https://github.com/abhivashist/JavaBootCamp/blob/master/src/Delete_a_File.java)
